# 1) Create an arithmetic circuit that takes signals x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ and is satisfied if at least one signal is 0

# 2) Create an arithmetic circuit that takes signals x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ and is satsified if all are 1.

# 3) A bipartite graph is a graph that can be colored with two colors such that no two neighboring nodes share the same
# color. Devise an arithmetic circuit scheme to show you have a valid witness of a 2-coloring of a graph.
# Hint: the scheme in this tutorial needs to be adjusted before it will work with a 2-coloring.
