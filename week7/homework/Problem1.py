# Let φ be the transformation of a column vector into a polynomial like we discussed in class (using lagrange
# interpolation over the x values [0, 1, …, n] and the y values being the values in the vector).
#
# Use Python compute:
# \phi(c\cdot\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix}) = c\cdot\phi(\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix})
#
# Test out a few vectors to convince yourself this is true in general.
#
# In English, what is the above equality stating?
